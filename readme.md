Soup Backbone Boilerplate 0.1.2
=========

Soup is just a boilerplate for your Backbone.js and Require.js applications.
At its core, it's no more than a pre-defined setup which should look very familiar to everyone who has worked before with Backbone.js and Require.js.

I packed a few ideas and best practices from all around the web community into this tiny starting project but it comes bundled with very little:

  - Index from HTML5 Boilerplate.
  - CSS Normalize.
  - Lodash instead of Underscore.
  - Text plugin.
  - Utils methods for better View usage
  - A sample template, view and model to get you started in no time.
  - A grunt.js file which allows you to compile your project to make it production friendly.
  - Already configured shims.

### Documentation ###

Soon.

### Usage ###

Fow now, simply download, and extract.
You may delete the sample instantiated View on the router.js file.

To build using grunt, install its dependencies by running "grunt install" and then run the pre-defined tasks
inside the grunt.js file. 'build' and 'compile' were already written for you, so check them out.
